# Machine-Learning-Term-Project-

This project is a part of Machine Learning course offered in BITS Goa
<br>

We have tried to implement the paper - A Nonlinear Generalization of Singular Value Decomposition and Its Applications to Mathematical Modeling and Chaotic Cryptanalysis by

Problem Defination - This paper proposes an extension of SVD for both the qualitative detection and quantitative determination of non-linear time series

we used the following links for some code snippets - 
for duffing equation - https://galileo-unbound.blog/2019/03/20/georg-duffing-and-his-equation/ 

Acknowledgement - We would like to thank Prof. Harikrishnan N. B for his invaluable guidance and assistance throughout the course of this term project.

This branch contains modified code of our implementation
